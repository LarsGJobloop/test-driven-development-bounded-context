# Continuous Assurance  
**Conquering Uncertainty through Test-Driven Development**  

## Introduction  

Software development is an ongoing process of discovery. Every change, every feature, and every bug fix introduces a degree of uncertainty. How can we be sure our code behaves as expected? How do we prevent regressions while evolving a system? **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** offers a structured way to reduce uncertainty by treating tests as experiments—probes into the behavior of our applications.  

This lecture will focus on **practical implementation**, using **Continuous Integration (CI)** to automate feedback loops and ensure our software behaves as expected. We will explore how to take a **specification from an imagined stakeholder** and use **TDD to iteratively evolve a system** while continuously verifying correctness.  

## Foundations  

### The Limits of Knowledge  

Tests do not prove correctness in an absolute sense—they only confirm what they explicitly check. A passing test tells us that the conditions we defined are met; a failing test indicates either an error in the system or a flaw in our assumptions.  

Like scientific experiments, tests serve as controlled inquiries into system behavior. The results refine our understanding, but they are never absolute. The question is not whether software is "correct" but whether we have gathered **enough evidence** to trust it.  

### Learning Through Feedback  

TDD transforms software development into a **feedback-driven learning process**. Each test is a hypothesis about how the system should behave. Running tests provides **immediate feedback**, allowing us to adjust, refactor, or redefine our approach.  

But tests are just one source of feedback. We combine them with **code reviews, integration pipelines, and stakeholder conversations** to refine our understanding. The goal is not just working code, but a system that evolves **with confidence**.  

## Practical Approach  

### Defining the Boundaries  

The world is too vast to capture in its entirety. To manage complexity, we define **bounded contexts**—specific domains within which our application operates. Within these boundaries, we can define **interfaces** that encapsulate system behavior.  

For this, we will use **OpenAPI** to describe a RESTful interface, serving as both a contract with stakeholders and a foundation for testable behavior. Through continuous dialog, specifications evolve alongside the implementation.  

### From Specification to Test  

A specification is not just a document—it is a starting point for validation. We begin by translating requirements into **executable tests**. These tests highlight **uncertainties**—gaps in knowledge or ambiguous expectations. Each uncertainty drives further refinement:  

1. From requirements, we derive a specification.  
2. From the specification, we construct a test.  
3. The test reveals unknowns and assumptions.  
4. These unknowns drive further tests.  

TDD is not just about writing tests first—it is about using tests to **systematically uncover and eliminate uncertainty**.  

### Continuous Integration: Sustaining Confidence  

Testing in isolation is not enough. Software is a living system, continuously changing. Before integrating changes, we must validate that our experiments align with expectations.  

By leveraging **Continuous Integration (CI)**, we automate the process of verifying that our tests remain valid. Each commit triggers a suite of checks, ensuring that modifications do not introduce regressions. This provides a **baseline level of assurance**—a safety net for rapid iteration and innovation.
