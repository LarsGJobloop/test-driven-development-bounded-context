# Continuous Assurance<br>*- Conquering Uncertainty*

## Content

### Theory

#### Boundaries of knowledge

- Tests prove only what they test, not what they don't.
- A failing test indicates an error in the system or an incorrect assumption in the test itself.

#### Feedback based knowledge aquisition

- Tests act as probes into system behavior, helping us confirm if the system behaves as expected.
- We use these along with all other tools to be certain they work as thought.

### Practice

#### Bounded Context

- The world is too vast, this is our domain
- Interface definition, OpenAPI
- A dialog with stakeholders

#### Boundary Testing

- From requirements, we derive a specification.
- From the specification a test
- From the test emerges uncertainty
- From the uncertainty we define more tests

#### Continuous Integration

- Before integrating changes, we validate that our experiments align with expectations, ensuring a baseline level of assurance.
